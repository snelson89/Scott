# Bio

I am a PhD candidate in the [Stony Brook Linguistics Department](https://www.linguistics.stonybrook.edu). [Here](info.txt) is some more information about me.

Some of my research interests include *model-theoretic phonology*, *phonological representations*, *phonetics-phonology interface*. One research question that I'm really fascinated with is **how to top-down and bottom-up factors play a role in speech perception?** I use `computational methods` when doing research.
